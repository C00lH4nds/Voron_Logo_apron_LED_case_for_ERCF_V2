# Voron-Logo-apron-LED-case-for-ERCF-V2

This is a customized apron LED case for ERCF V2, with Voron logo shaped diffusers.

### BOM
|Item|Qty|
|---|---|		
|RGB LED strip - 8 LEDS |1|
|M3x8 SHCS or FHCS screws|3|
|M3 T-nuts|3|

### Printing instructions
Use translucent filament for the diffusers and ppaque filament for the other parts.
Print with usual parameters for Voron parts. There are tight tolerances between the diffusers and the front body so depedning on how your printer is tuned there might be some filing necessary.
Two case bodies are provided, one for FHCS screxs and one for SCHS. SHCS is slightly bigger to fit the screw heads without touching the LEDS.

### Assembly instructions
Put the diffusers in the front part, and then put the LEDs from the cut RGB LED strips on top

The front part with diffusers act as a soldering jig, you can solder the wires now if you want them on the back of the LEDs.
If you prefer having the wires on the front of the LEDs, stick the support plate on the LEDs, remove the support plate with the LEDs and solder the wires

Snap everything together and use the M3 T-nuts and screws to set the case on the front 20x20 extrusion of the ERCF
